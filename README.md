# Description
This command is made to ban all users of a specific role or all the server members.It is really dangerous and i dont recommend using it.Thats why you can also see @commands.is_owner.This command can be used only from the owner of the bot so it can not be abused.I repeat DO NOT use this command or use it if its neccesary.Have @commands.is_owner always on the command so it can not be abused.
